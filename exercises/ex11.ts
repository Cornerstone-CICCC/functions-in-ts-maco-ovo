// Expected result: Write a function called displayLikes that takes in an array of names and returns a string of who likes the post.

// The function should return a string formatted as follows:

// If no one likes it, it should return 'no one likes this'
// If one person likes it, it should return '{name} likes this'
// If two people like it, it should return '{name1} and {name2} like this'
// If three people like it, it should return '{name1}, {name2} and {name3} like this'
// If more than three people like it, it should return '{name1}, {name2} and {x} others like this'

const displayLikes = (names: string[]): string => {
  switch (names.length) {
    case 0:
      return 'no one likes this';
    case 1:
      return `${names[0]} likes this`;
    case 2:
      return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`;
    case 3:
      return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
    default:
      return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length - 2} others like this`;
  }
};

export default displayLikes;

displayLikes(["Jacob", "Alex"]); // Expected result: 'Jacob and Alex like this'
displayLikes(["Max", "John", "Mark"]); // Expected result: 'Max, John and Mark like this'
